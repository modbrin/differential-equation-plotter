# Differential Equation Plotter

> This project demonstrates three numeric methods for solving differential equations. (Euler, Euler Improved and Runge-Kutta methods) Algorithms are implemented in application with GUI based on Qt Framework, Plotting was done using QCustomPlot module. Sources are provided as C++ code.

>Note: Substituting the equation itself could be implemented with appropriate parser, although not done here.
